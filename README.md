# Assembly Code Error: Potential Null Pointer Dereference and Memory Access Violation

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: attempting to access memory without proper error handling. The code increments a value in memory but fails to handle cases where the memory address is invalid or inaccessible, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.asm` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version that includes error checking before accessing memory.
